üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Web server (optional, can run locally)

Installation

Clone or Download
bash# If using git
git clone [repository-url]

# Or download the HTML file directly

Run Locally
bash# Option 1: Open directly in browser
open index.html

# Option 2: Use a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .

Access the Application

Direct file: file://path/to/index.html
Local server: http://localhost:8000



üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Demonstrated
XSS Prevention
javascript// Secure implementation
function displayUserProfile(username) {
    const profileElement = document.getElementById('profile');
    const welcomeElement = document.createElement('h3');
    welcomeElement.textContent = 'Welcome ' + sanitizeInput(username) + '!';
    profileElement.appendChild(welcomeElement);
}
Input Validation
javascript// Comprehensive email validation
function validateEmail(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailRegex.test(email) && email.length <= 254;
}
CSRF Protection
javascript// Secure API requests with CSRF tokens
function deleteUser(userId) {
    fetch('/api/users/' + userId, {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': getCSRFToken(),
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + getAuthToken()
        }
    });
}
üìñ Usage Guide
Interactive Demo

Navigate to the Demo Section

Try entering malicious scripts like <script>alert('XSS')</script>
Compare "Vulnerable Submit" vs "Secure Submit" outputs


Test Input Validation

Enter various email formats to see validation in action
Observe real-time border color changes for validity indicators


Review Code Examples

Study the vulnerable code patterns (marked in red)
Examine secure implementations (marked in green)

üõ†Ô∏è Security Recommendations
Implementation Checklist

‚úÖ Always sanitize and validate user inputs on both client and server side
‚úÖ Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks
‚úÖ Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all data transmission
‚úÖ Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
‚úÖ Use secure session management with httpOnly cookies
‚úÖ Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
‚úÖ Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
‚úÖ Use parameterized queries for database operations
‚úÖ Implement logging and monitoring for security events

Security Headers
httpContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
